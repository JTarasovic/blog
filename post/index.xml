RISC-V Quickstart Examples I started looking through the quickstart examples to see if there were any other examples I wanted to flash while I was poking around at it. More importantly though, I wanted to start getting into the habit of reading and mentally parsing Rust.</description></item><item><title>Embedded Rust Day 1</title><link>https://blog.tarasovic.cloud/post/embedded-rust-day-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 19:41:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tarasovic.cloud/post/embedded-rust-day-1/</guid><description>Day 1 is done. I spent a fair amount of time writing the introductory post. Additionally, while I am waiting on materials to arrive, I started to set up my environment.
Getting Started First things first. I started looking around to figure out how to get set up to do embedded Rust work.
I already have rustup installed so nothing to do there yet.
Next, I wanted to get my HiFive1 Rev B running using the riscv-rust-quickstart.</description></item><item><title>Embedded Rust Introduction</title><link>https://blog.tarasovic.cloud/post/embedded-rust-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 19:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tarasovic.cloud/post/embedded-rust-introduction/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on a journey to better understand how computers work by learning about embedded development, FPGAs, Operating Systems and more. My rather aspirational goal is to work on it every day with, at least, a short post here about what I did and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I welcome you to come along for the journey.
Why? It may be instructive to start with why I am interested in this before proceeding to what I hope to achieve.</description></item></channel></rss>
